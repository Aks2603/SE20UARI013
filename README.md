The sensor we used is an infrared sensor.It is a radiation-sensitive optoelectronic component with a spectral sensitivity in the infrared wavelength range 780 nm 50µm.
The specifics of our sensor used are
Detection distance: 2 ~ 30cm
Detection angle: 35 °
Comparator chip: LM393
We have used the raspi in our lab to do the work.
We used firbase for data analysis.
A small brief on IR Sensors:
IR sensors are now widely used in motion detectors, which are used in building services to switch on lamps or in alarm systems to detect unwelcome guests. In a defined angle range, the sensor elements detect the heat radiation (infrared radiation) that changes over time and space due to the movement of people.
